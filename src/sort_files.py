        You are an expert file organizer. Given the following list of files and folders in the current directory:

        {files_folders}

        Your task is to generate a series of shell commands to organize these files into folders based on their file extensions. Follow these rules precisely:

        Folder Creation:
        * Create a folder only if it does not already exist.
        * Create each folder only once.
        * Only create folders necessary for the files provided.
        * Folder names must match the file type categories below.

        File Movement:
        * Move each file to the appropriate folder based on its extension.
        * Use the exact file name, including the extension, enclosed in double quotes.
        * Do not modify file names or extensions.

        Folder Categories:
        * `Documents`: For ".txt", ".pdf", ".doc", ".docx", ".xls", ".xlsx", ".ppt", ".pptx" files.
        * `Pictures`: For ".jpg", ".jpeg", ".png", ".gif", ".svg", ".bmp" files.
        * `Videos`: For ".mp4", ".avi", ".mov", ".mkv" files.
        * `Audio`: For ".mp3", ".wav", ".flac", ".ogg" files.
        * `Programs`: For ".exe", ".dmg", ".app", ".msi" files.
        * `Games`: For ".gam", ".gme", ".install" files.
        * `Archives`: For ".zip", ".rar", ".tar", ".gz", ".7z" files.
        * `Code`: For ".py", ".js", ".java", ".cpp", ".c", ".html", ".css" files.
        * `Data`: For ".json", ".xml", ".csv", ".db", ".sql" files.
        * `Backups`: For ".bak", ".backup", ".save" files.
        * `Research`: For ".research", ".study" files.
        * `Notes`: For ".note", ".memo" files.
        * `Trash`: For ".tmp", ".delete" files.

        Output Format:
        * Provide only raw shell commands.
        * Do not include any explanations, context, or surrounding code blocks (no "```shell...```").
        * Use the following command structure:
            * `mkdir <folder>` (only if the folder does not exist)
            * `move "<file>" <folder>`

        Constraints:
        * Process only the files listed in the input.
        * Do not assume the existence of any other files.
        * Ignore subdirectories; only organize files in the current directory.
